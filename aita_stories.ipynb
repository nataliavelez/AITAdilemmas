      "This whole episode went down about a year ago. Basically, I was doing an exchange program at a college in Japan. The classes were all co educational with Japanese and foreign students. My program only had about 35 or so people, so almost everyone was on a first name basis with each other and we were a fairly tight knit group. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Because of this, we often had class parties where everyone hung out and talked/drank/etc... At one of these parties, I noticed that one of my female Japanese friends was being cornered and forced to talk with another American exchange student, and was looking a little bit uncomfortable. I went over and asked her if she could go help me get more drinks from the supermarket, and she used the excuse to hurry out of there. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From now on, I'm going to call this dickhead \"D\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was hoping this would be a one and done thing, but in the following days I noticed that my friend seemed a little on edge around D. One day, I pretty much layed it out and asked her if the incident at the party was bothering her and if there was anything I could do about it. She confided in me that D had also been begging her to date him, sending her explicit messages about what he would \"do to her\", and messaging her dick pics even after she asked him to stop. Apparently that party wasn't the first time he'd cornered her either, and he had a pretty significant size advantage on her too, so It was easy to see why she was so intimidated. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After she told me all that, I gotta admit, I was pretty furious. I urged her to report that kind of thing to the dean, or the police, but she told that she did not want to tell the adminstrators or authorities about it. While I'm no expert on Japanese culture or criminal procedure, but she made it sound like there was a significant chance she might get brushed off or not believed if she escalated it. Plus once word got back to D, she might have a pissed off white guy on her ass with 50 pounds and a foot on her. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Normally I'm a goody two shoes, but at that point I was willing to do anything short of an ass beating (had to think of my Visa) to get back at this asshole. My chance came a few weeks later, when I got invited to a gaming discord group with some of the other guys from my program, including D. I was reading back in old chats, because I was still trying to read up on this guy. Concincidentally, I happened upon an exchange where him and the other guys were joking around by messaging each other weird porn in the chat. It was mostly pretty ridiculous stuff, like that spider porn video and shit like that, until I spotted it: in the chat D had posted a picture of \"lolicon\" hentai (drawn child porn for those who don't know). I screenshotted it fast and saved it on my computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I debated back and forth for a while, but eventually I did it. I cropped the screenshot I had taken of D's \"lolicon\" message and uploaded it on social media. When I posted it, I cut off the joking context, and essentially painted D as a bona fide pedophile and myself as a \"whistleblower\" so to speak. I thought that everyone would look at him weird and whisper behind his back, and that it would humilate him but eventually blow over. I was dead wrong on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My post \"blew up\" about as much as it could have in a social media group with less than 100 people. I had a reputation as being good student and pretty serious guy, so a lot of people took my post at face value. Apparently, I also wasn't the only one with a bone to pick with D, and soon a bunch of people had come forwards with accounts of him being creepy or harrassing them. All his friends cut him off to avoid being associated with the drama, and eventually someone forwarded the school staff the pictures/reports about D. I don't know what happened to him, but he didn't come back at the start of the next semester.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " From what I've seen of his social media, he hasn't really recovered yet. I saw him posting on some depression support type groups, which is actually what prompted me to make this post. While I know he probably deserved to be called out, I dont want him to kill himself or anything. I can't help but feel like a real dick, both for betraying my own morals and for letting it get so out of hand. I don't know if I should apologize to him, or just let sleeping dogs lie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: I Cherry picked photographs from a discord chat to make a guy who sexually harrased my friend look like a kiddy-fiddler, smearing his reputation in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: Some people are messaging me asking for more info on what I meant by \"changing the context\" of D's message. I did not edit his post in any way or put words in his mouth, simply cut out the single message where he put up Loli porn and posted it with a comment like \"can't believe this disgusting shit I just saw in a group chat. Shame on you D\". \n",

      "[This is how one of my neighbors ](https://imgur.com/a/OwIpdev) has chosen to decorate their yard this year for Halloween. Am I being overly sensitive here or is this as distasteful as I think it is? To me the line is crossed when they went out of their way to dress their life sized skeleton in regular street clothes. I had to do a double take the first time I drove by it. I can appreciate an edgy joke here and there and Iâm normally not the type to be offended easily but I just think this display is a little too much.

      "I normally work from home, but I had to come into the office for a few days, because I am applying for a new position and I wanted to shake hands and do an interview in person. It is about a 3.5 hour drive to the main office building, so my wife, our 2 kids, and I all planned to stay at a relatives house during this time. The relativeâs house was empty(they were going to be on vacation during this time).\n",

They forgot to let us know until just then. My wife had no intention of staying there while they were there too, so we was very upset by this and pleaded with me to find a hotel instead. We had no money for that, so I said we couldnât do it. We sat there arguing for a long time, she was crying for most of it saying things like âI donât want to go!â and âdonât make me go!â.\n",

Normally I work from home so I can help her, but in this situation she has no help and she feels overwhelmed. That is the reason she told me. I, like I said, think that's a crappy reason, and I kinda wanted her to suck it up.\n",

Recently I started seeing this guy, who I really like, and we've been friends for over a year before merging into a relationship. He is Christian, and while has no hate towards her or any other LGBT community member, he isn't all for it and believes it to be a sin in the eyes of his religion. He has never said anything to them about it, actually likes hanging out with them, ect. But they asked how he felt and he was pretty blunt about the sin thing. \n",

Jane has decided she wants nothing to do with me because I won't ghost him and refuse to have any contact with him. She hates me because I chose to have him in my life. I fully understand that this is her lifestyle, and not something she can change, but I guess I'm at a loss as to how easily she can turn her back on me and I must not be fully understanding the betrayal she believes I've done to her.\n",

She and I have a complicated friendship, that has never been strong and she's cut me out of her life numerous times before. The only reason we're really good friends at all is because her long term girlfriend and I are incredibly close, and still are. *This is not me downplaying our friendship* we are very close when we are on good terms. However this situation I can see her being fully justified cutting me off.\n",

She said she doesnât either so she got on birth control for the rest of the time and then we were fine during all that time then she got off birth control because she says that birth control can affect her hormones and cause her not to be able to have babies which i completely understood since i wanted to have babies with her eventually. So i started using condoms but then she convinced me to not use them again. I reiterated that do not want kids right now and she agreed to the same i then asked what would she do if she got pregnant and she did say she would abort it.
